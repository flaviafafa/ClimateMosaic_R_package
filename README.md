# ClimateMosaic for Climate Analysis and Viz

ClimateMosaic is a ready-to-publish R package for analyzing climate patterns at weather stations and making and visualizing interpolations for the U.S. It is called ClimateMosaic because the interpolation plots look like a mosaic. See example implementations: https://github.com/flaviafafa/ClimateMosaic_R_package/blob/main/vignette.pdf

This was the final project for STSCI4520 Statistical Computing in the spring of 2024, which ended up receiving a perfect score :)
